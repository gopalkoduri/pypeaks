        This function expects SMOOTHED histogram. If you run it on a raw histogram,
        there is a high chance that it returns no peaks.

        method can be interval/slope/hybrid.
            The interval-based method simply steps through the whole histogram
            and pick up the local maxima in each interval, from which irrelevant
            peaks are filtered out by looking at the proportion of points on 
            either side of the detected peak in each interval, and by applying
            peal_amp_thresh and valley_thresh bounds.
        
            Slope approach uses, of course slope information, to find peaks, 
            which are then filtered by applying peal_amp_thresh and 
            valley_thresh bounds. 
            
            Hybrid approach combines the peaks obtained using slope method and
            interval-based approach. It retains the peaks/valleys from slope method
            if there should be a peak around the same region from each of the methods.
        
        peak_amp_thresh is the minimum amplitude/height that a peak should have
        in a normalized smoothed histogram, to be qualified as a peak. 
        valley_thresh is viceversa for valleys!

        If the method is interval/hybrid, then the intervals argument must be passed
        and it should be an instance of Intervals class.

        If the method is slope/hybrid, then the lookahead and avg_window
        arguments should be changed based on the application. 
        They have some default values though.

        The method stores peaks in self.peaks in the following format:
